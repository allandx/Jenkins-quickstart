Building an app (using gradle build)as a freestyle jenkins project:

- Configure Jenkins to authenticate with GitHub server. Generate an access token in the fork copy, include API url
- Create a freestyle project in Jenkins and configure it to include git as scm and its project URL
- Set up a webhook to trigger the build whenever changes are made to the repository in GitHub - how: under build trigger( "github hook trigger for GITScm polling)
- Configure the build to archive output as a build artifact
